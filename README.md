# Minesweeper

A terminal-based [Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) game. This project was a practice problem for [Triplebyte interviews](https://triplebyte.com/static/interview_guide_2h_v2). This took me 2 hours and 39 minutes to create.

## Usage

Using a terminal,
```
$ python main.py
```
